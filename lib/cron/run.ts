/**
 * The full refresh, as one function.
 *
 * Previously the HTTP route and the `npm run refresh` script each did their own
 * thing, and only the route recorded a `cron_runs` row. Since the GitHub
 * Actions job runs the script — the HTTP route cannot, because a full refresh
 * takes about four minutes against a 60s function limit — nothing in
 * production was ever writing a run record, and the /admin dashboard would
 * have shown "the refresh has not run recently" permanently while the refresh
 * ran perfectly every 15 minutes.
 *
 * One implementation, both callers, one place that records the run.
