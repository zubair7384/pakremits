/**
 * Delivery-method pages.

 * These target a different search intent from the corridor pages: someone who

 * does that, rather than someone comparing services from a country. So the
 * copy answers "how does this rail work and what are its limits", not "which
 * provider costs least" — the table answers that.
 *
 * Same caveat as the corridor content: facts here age, `lastReviewed` says
 * when they were last checked, and NEEDS VERIFICATION marks figures that must
 * be confirmed against the primary source before launch.
