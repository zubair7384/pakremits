  'A Roshan Digital Account is a Pakistani bank account that non-resident Pakistanis can open ' +
  'remotely, without visiting Pakistan, using a NICOP, POC or a non-resident CNIC. The State ' +
  'Bank introduced the scheme in 2020. It is worth having if you send regularly or want to hold ' +
  'money in Pakistan rather than convert it immediately, because it also gives access to ' +
  'rupee and dollar certificates. It is not a faster way to send a one-off transfer.'

const INCENTIVE_ANSWER =
  'The State Bank of Pakistan reimburses banks and money transfer operators for remittances ' +
  'sent through approved channels, which is why so many licensed services show a zero fee on ' +
  'transfers to Pakistan rather than the two or three percent you would expect. The subsidy goes ' +
  'to the provider, not to you, so it shows up as a lower headline cost rather than a payment. ' +
  'It also means the option with the lowest headline cost is not automatically the one that delivers the most ' +
  'rupees — the exchange rate still does most of the work.'

const WALLET_ANSWER =
  'Yes, if the provider supports mobile wallet payout. Choose “JazzCash or Easypaisa” under ' +
  '“Recipient gets it in” and the table only shows services that pay out to wallets, with the ' +
  'wallet-specific rate and delivery time, which are often different from the bank ones. Your ' +
  'recipient needs the wallet registered against their CNIC. Wallets have monthly receiving ' +
  'limits that depend on the account level, so a large transfer may need a bank account instead. ' +
