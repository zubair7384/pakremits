/**
 * Locale routing.
 *
 * Note we use next-intl for messages and formatting but *not* for its routing
 * middleware. Two reasons:
 *
 *  1. The middleware slot is already taken by the /admin basic-auth check in
 *     proxy.ts, and composing the two adds a failure mode for no benefit here.
 *  2. Our URLs are not a clean locale prefix anyway — the pretty corridor and
 *     rate URLs are already rewrites, so locale routing is expressed in the
 *     same next.config.ts rewrite table rather than in a second mechanism.
 *
 * English lives at the root (`/`, `/gbp-to-pkr`) and Urdu under `/ur`. The
 * `[locale]` segment is filled by the rewrites, so no locale detection or
 * redirect ever runs — a reader who lands on an English URL stays there.
