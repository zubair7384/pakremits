/**
 * URL mapping.
 *
 * Two things are happening here, both of which exist because the URLs we want
 * to publish do not match the shape Next's file router can express.
 *
 * 1. **Pretty URLs.** Next dynamic segments must be a whole path segment, so
 *    `send-money-from-[slug]-to-pakistan` is not expressible as a folder. The
 *    pages live at `/corridor/[slug]`, `/rate/[currency]` and `/method/[slug]`,
 *    and these rewrites expose the public form. robots.txt disallows the
 *    internal forms so the two never compete for the same ranking signal.
 *
 * 2. **An unprefixed default locale.** Pages live under `/[locale]`, but
 *    English must be served from the root — `/gbp-to-pkr`, not `/en/gbp-to-pkr`.
 *
 * Everything is in `beforeFiles` and every English path is listed explicitly.
 * A catch-all `/:path*` → `/en/:path*` would be shorter but wrong: it runs
 * after route matching, and `/how-we-rank` already matches `/[locale]` with
 * locale="how-we-rank", so it would never reach the rewrite. Listing the paths
 * is verbose and obvious, which beats short and subtly broken.
 *
 * Adding a page therefore means adding a line here. That is the cost of clean
 * URLs plus an unprefixed default locale, and it is worth it.
