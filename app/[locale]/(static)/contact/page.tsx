        Email is the fastest way to reach us. There is no form because a form would mean storing

        This is the message we most want to get. Providers change their pricing structures without
        warning and our parsers occasionally read a new shape incorrectly. Tell us the provider,
        the corridor, and roughly when you looked, and we will check it against the source and fix
        it. A screenshot helps but is not necessary.

          If you would like to be listed, get in touch — particularly if you can offer a quote API,
          which is far more reliable for both of us than us reading your website.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like us to stop fetching quotes from you, say so and we will remove you the
          same day. You do not need to give a reason and you do not need to send a legal letter.

        Every rate-alert message has a one-tap unsubscribe link that deletes your contact details
        outright. If you would rather ask us directly, email the address above and we will handle
        it without asking why.
